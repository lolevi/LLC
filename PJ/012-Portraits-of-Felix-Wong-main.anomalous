  <h3>Portraits of Felix Wong</h3>
  <p>
    This photography project was marketing orientated and commercial.
    Even though it was huge and important, the process of photo shooting was joyful, interactive and memorable.
  </p>


  <h3>Interaction with Felix 黃日華</h3>
  <p class="em1-25 gtbm" style="color: black;">
    『一開始唔使笑住，留返等陣慢慢。』
    <br>
    "Don't have to smile now. Save it for later."
  </p>
  <p>
    Felix is a very experienced actor. His reflex actions took him to those epic postures spontaneously,
    like James-Bond-style facial expressions, classic smile, gentleman moves, etc.
    However, I needed many different styles from those ordery presentations for future marketing materials.
    He was professional and responded to my preference accurately. I directed this shooting smoothly.
    I’d like to acknowledge the effort of every production party:
    Joseph Lai (Advertising Agency),
    Lawrence Mak (Photographer) & his crews,
    Jeff Tong & William Fung (Videographers),
    and, of course, my very best designers - Mavis Cheung (in early stage), Jojo Chung & Suki Sze-To.

  <h3>
    Overview of this Portrait Project
  </h3>
  <p>
    Throwback to 2016, I was the person in charge of all design related things in Safe Gold Financial Holdings.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once the renewal of the contract of Felix as the advertising person of the company was decided,
    we started preparing the plan of the contract renewal ceremony and arranging the photography.
    <br>
    <br>
    We analysed the designs for marketing in the past to find out what we wanted this time.
    After meeting with marketing and the advertising agency, the general direction of this photo shooting was settled - 4 themes: classic, formal, outdoor and sporty.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the day of contract renewal, the tailor was here to measure Felix.
    2 months of preparation, we met Felix again in a photographic studio.
