  <h2 class="Project-Nature">Branding / SEO / Progress</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    SEO triggered the cutting off of my 2 year relationship with Google Blogger.
    The full story is at <a href="../PJ/009-the-story-of-levi-lo-com.html#The-SEO">“The SEO” section in the story of levi-lo.com</a> (LLC).
    <br>
    <br>
    The situation was bad.
    There were many inexact “Levi Lo” results which pushed the exact “Levi Lo” to the fifth page of the result when searching my name.
    (Based on the result by the 3rd version of LLC.)
  </p>
  <p class="colour10 gtpm em2">
    The aim was simple.
    <br>
    “Levi Lo” should be “Levi Lo”.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the 4th ver. of LLC published for a week, the ranking didn’t change. I didn’t check it everyday.
    17 days later, my site popped up on the first page, just right after my “Levi Lo” Facebook account and another Facebook account called “Levi Lo”.
    Finally, real “Levi Lo” can be shown on “Levi Lo”’s.
