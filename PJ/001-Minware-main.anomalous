  <h3>
    Embracing Minnan Culture
  </h3>
  <p>
    Shishi (石獅) is a city in Southern Min, China. Its literal meaning in Chinese is “stone lion”. According to legend, there was densely populated in the Sui Dynasty as ancestors were engaged in the production of sea salt and people often meet at a
    stone lion in front of a temple, "Shishi" was named for it.
    <br>
    <br> Setting up a stone lion as an amulet for stopping wind and safety is a Minnan coastal area traditional culture. The brand logo is the visualization of a stone lion to carry the tradition’s content.

  <h3>
    Stage 1 - Pitching
  </h3>
  <p>
    Sino culture was the common ground, with provided restaurant visual identity which showed the concept of the direction of the style itself clearly, the first proposal including three design directions was done.

  <h3>
    Stage 2 - Trip
  </h3>
  <p>The design proposal was acknowledged. I was invited to Shishi. Local heritage tours, museums, city walks, those were giving deep insights of Minnan culture.
    <br>
    <br>Design to presentation was their concern. The restaurant manager led different local high-end restaurant visits, showing how Minnan cuisines bloomed.
    <br>
    <br>While the new restaurant was under construction, the executive chef brought me to the kitchen inside the hotel, which was at the same flow. The stories of the dishes behind were told, how they came up with the dishes, the spirits inside as
    well.
    <br>
    <br>Having conversations with both waitstaff and kitchen staff, the expectation of handling the new tablewares was concluded. The management level brought out their vision, especially to the customers. The user experience direction was clear.

  <h3>
    Stage 3 - Design Interim
  </h3>
  <p>
    After concluding all parties’ expectations, the detailed production list was settled. Designer team was set and further developed those 3 directions. From R&D to 3D prototypes, everything was presented in an interim report.

  <h3>
    Final Stage
  </h3>
  <p>
    One set of design was selected as the main steam, some elements from other sets were endorsed and applied. Design was finalized and submitted. 2 months later, I revisited the restaurant in Shishi.
